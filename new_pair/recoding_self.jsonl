Return a tuple containing the count of even and odd palindromes.\n\nBased on this decomposition, the high-level plan for the program can be outlined as follows:\n\n1. Define the `is_palindrome` function:\n\n    a. Convert the number to a string.\n    b. Check if the string is equal to its reverse.\n    c. Return True if it is a palindrome, False otherwise.\n\n2. Implement the `even_odd_palindrome` function:\n\n    a. Initialize two counters, `even_count` and `odd_count`, to 0.\n    b. Iterate over the range from 1 to n+1.\n    c. For each number:\n        - Check if it is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function.\n        - If it is a palindrome:\n            - Increment `even_count` if the number is even.\n            - Increment `odd_count` if the number is odd.\n    d.
