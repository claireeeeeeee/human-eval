It checks whether there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other (i.e., the difference between the numbers is less than the threshold). The function returns a boolean value indicating the result.\n   \n   - To implement this function, the developer needs to iterate over the list of numbers and compare each number with the rest of the numbers. If the absolute difference between any two numbers is less than the threshold, the function should return True. If no such pair of numbers is found, the function should return False.\n\n   - It is important to handle edge cases (e.g., empty list, negative threshold) and ensure that the function adheres to the provided type hints in the function signature.\n\n4.

{"HumanEval/19Project Leader1": "As the project leader, my plan for managing the development of the \"sort_numbers\" function is as follows:\n\n1. Import Statement:\nThe developer needs to import the \"typing\" package to ensure type hints are used correctly. Therefore, the import statement should include:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n```\n\n2. Function Signature:\nThe function signature should include the function name \"sort_numbers\" and the parameter that the function accepts. Based on the requirement, the function should accept a string representing space-delimited numerals. Therefore, the function signature should be:\n```python\ndef sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:\n```\n\n3. NL Description:\nThe NL description provides guidance and context for the developers to understand the objective of the function. Based on the requirement, the NL description for the \"sort_numbers\" function should be as follows:\n```\nThe \"sort_numbers\" function takes a space-delimited string of numerals from 'zero' to 'nine' as input. The valid choices are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', and 'nine'. The function should sort the numbers in ascending order and return the string with the sorted numbers. For example, if the input is 'three one five', the function should return 'one three five'.\n```\nAdditionally, it's important to highlight any specific constraints or edge cases that developers need to consider while developing the function. In this case, the developers need to ensure that the input string only contains valid numerals.\n\n4. Test cases:\nIt is up to the developers to generate their own test cases and test the function. They should consider various scenarios, such as different combinations of numerals and empty input, to ensure the function works as expected.\n\nBy providing this high-level plan, the developers will have a clear understanding of the task at hand and can proceed with the implementation of the \"sort_numbers\" function."}

NL Description:\n   - Developers should create a function called `unique` that takes in a list as a parameter and returns a new list containing the sorted unique elements from the input list. The function should remove duplicates from the input list and sort the elements in ascending order. The output list should be returned.\n\n4. Test Cases:\n   - It is the responsibility of the developer to generate test cases for the `unique` function and ensure that it satisfies the requirements mentioned in the NL description.\n   - Example test cases for the `unique` function:\n     ```python\n     # Test case 1\n     assert unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]\n\n     # Test case 2\n     assert unique([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) == [1]\n\n     # Test case 3\n     assert unique([]) == []\n\n     # Test case 4\n     assert unique([9, 8, 7, 6]) == [6, 7, 8, 9]\n     ```\n\n**Note:** The provided test cases are just examples. Developers should generate additional test cases to thoroughly test the functionality of the `unique` function.\n\nOnce the developers have implemented the function according to the plan provided by the project leader, it is the responsibility of the quality assurance testers to test the function. The objective of the quality assurance testers will be to ensure that the function works correctly as per the given specifications and the code from the developer is free of any bugs.\n\nThe quality assurance testers should follow these steps:\n\n1.

Verify return type and behavior:\n   - Check if the function returns a list.\n   - Check if the function removes duplicates from the input list.\n   - Check if the function sorts the elements in ascending order.\n   - Check if the function returns a new list containing the sorted unique elements.\n\n3. Validate the function against the provided test cases:\n   - Run the provided test cases to validate the functionality of the `unique` function.\n   - Ensure that the output of the function matches the expected output for each test case.\n   - If the function fails any of the test cases, investigate and report the issue to the developers.\n\n4. Generate additional test cases:\n   - Create additional test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases.\n   - Test the function with empty lists, lists containing only duplicates, and lists with random elements.\n   - Verify that the function handles all scenarios correctly.\n\n5. Create and maintain test documentation:\n   - Document the procedure followed for testing, including the steps taken, test cases used, and their outcomes.\n   - Note any issues or bugs found during testing and communicate them to the developers.\n\n6. Provide feedback and suggestions to enhance the function:\n   - Communicate with the developers to provide feedback regarding the function's performance and code quality.\n   - Offer suggestions for improvements or optimizations if applicable.\n\nBy following this high-level plan, the quality assurance testers can ensure that the developed function meets the requirements and functions correctly in various scenarios. Their feedback will aid the developers in refining the function and delivering a robust and effective solution."}

The goal is to reverse the cyclic encoding done by the `encode_cyclic` function.\n\nThe steps to implement the `decode_cyclic` function are as follows:\n- Create a variable `decoded` and initialize it as an empty string. This variable will be used to store the decoded string.\n- Split the input string `s` into groups of three characters, similar to what was done in the `encode_cyclic` function.\n- For each group of three characters, check if the group has exactly three characters.\n  - If the group has three characters, the characters need to be cycled (moved one position to the left).\n    - Extract the first character and append it to the end of the group.\n  - Append the modified or unmodified group to the `decoded` string.\n- Return the `decoded` string as the output of the function.\n\n4.

NL Description:\n   The `decode_shift` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. The input string is encoded using a simple shifting algorithm, where each character is shifted back by 5 positions in the alphabet. The function should reverse this encoding process to obtain the original string.\n\n   The algorithm for decoding a character can be defined as follows:\n   - Convert each character to its ASCII code using the `ord` function.\n   - Subtract the ASCII code of the lowercase \"a\" character.\n   - Take the modulus of 26 (total number of lowercase alphabets) to handle wrapping.\n   - Add the ASCII code of the lowercase \"a\" character to get the decoded character.\n\n   The `decode_shift` function should iterate over each character in the input string and apply this decoding algorithm to obtain the decoded string.\n\n4. Test Cases:\n   - Test Case 1:\n     - Input: `encode_shift(\"afyxy\")`\n     - Expected Output: `\"tawst\"`\n\n   - Test Case 2:\n     - Input: `encode_shift(\"jruuxqj\")`\n     - Expected Output: `\"emppsmu\"`\n\n   - Test Case 3:\n     - Input: `encode_shift(\"pbclfd\")`\n     - Expected Output: `\"kwxuay\"`\n\n(Note: The test cases assume that the `encode_shift` function has been already implemented.)\n\nThis high-level plan provides the necessary information for the developers to understand the requirements of the `decode_shift` function and develop it accordingly."}

{"HumanEval/38Project Leader1": "High-Level Plan for Developing the `decode_cyclic` Function:\n\n1. Import Statement:\nThe developer should include the following import statement at the beginning of the function:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n```\n\n2. Function Signature:\nThe function signature for the `decode_cyclic` function should be as follows:\n```python\ndef decode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:\n```\n\n3. NL Description:\nThe `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the original decoded string. The function should reverse the encoding process performed by the `encode_cyclic` function. \n\n- First, the `decode_cyclic` function needs to split the input string into groups of three characters, similar to the `encode_cyclic` function.\n- Then, for each group, the function needs to reverse the cyclic shift performed by the `encode_cyclic` function. If a group has fewer than three characters, it should be left as it is.\n- Finally, the function should concatenate all the reversed groups to form the decoded string.\n\n4. Test Cases:\nPlease provide the developer with the following test cases/examples to validate the correctness of the `decode_cyclic` function:\n\nTest Case 1:\n```python\nencoded_string = \"ypTAniGreolBgcC\"\ndecoded_string = decode_cyclic(encoded_string)\n# Expected Output: \"pythonicBlargC\"\n```\n\nTest Case 2:\n```python\nencoded_string = \"dEcoCCdyncCrial\"\ndecoded_string = decode_cyclic(encoded_string)\n# Expected Output: \"DecodeCyclicTrial\"\n```\n\nTest Case 3:\n```python\nencoded_string = \"abC\"\ndecoded_string = decode_cyclic(encoded_string)\n# Expected Output: \"abC\"\n```\n\nNote: The developer should add their own test cases to thoroughly test the functionality of the `decode_cyclic` function.\n\n5. Additional Notes:\n- Ensure the function is well-documented with appropriate docstrings and clear variable names.\n- Encourage the use of helper functions if necessary for improving the modularity and readability of the code.\n- The developer should adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines and maintain code readability.\n- Encourage the developer to run the provided test cases as well as create additional ones to ensure the correct functionality of the `decode_cyclic` function."}

So, we can calculate the total number of collisions by summing the numbers from 1 to `n`.\n\nThe code also includes test cases to verify the correctness of the implementation.

NL Description:\nThe `iscube` function takes an integer `a` as a parameter and returns `True` if the given integer is a cube of some other integer, otherwise it returns `False`. \n\nTo implement this function, the developers should follow these steps:\n\n- Check if `a` is equal to 0. If it is, return `True` as 0 is a cube of 0.\n- If `a` is less than 0, negate `a` as the cube of a negative number is positive.\n- Take the absolute value of `a` to ensure consistent comparisons.\n- Use a loop to check if there exists an integer `i` such that `i*i*i` is equal to `a`.\n- If such an `i` is found, return `True`.\n- If the loop completes without finding an appropriate `i`, return `False`.\n\nIt is important for the developers to handle edge cases such as handling negative numbers and zero correctly.\n\n4. Test cases:\nDevelopers should generate their own test cases to ensure the function works correctly.

{"HumanEval/59Quality assurance": "As a project leader, your goal is to devise a high-level plan to manage and direct the work of the developers. This plan is designed to guide the developers in implementing the required function, \"largest_prime_factor\", and ensure that it meets the specified requirements.\n\nHigh-Level Plan to Manage the Development of the \"largest_prime_factor\" Function:\n\n1. Import Statement:\nThe developer needs to import any necessary packages for the development of the \"largest_prime_factor\" function. Based on the requirement, no special packages are required for this function.\n\n2. Function Signature:\nThe function signature for the \"largest_prime_factor\" function should be as follows:\n```python\ndef largest_prime_factor(n: int):\n```\nThis indicates that the function name should be \"largest_prime_factor\" and it should accept a single parameter of type integer.\n\n3. NL Description:\nThe \"largest_prime_factor\" function should aim to return the largest prime factor of the input number, \"n\". The following steps can be used as a guideline to develop the function:\n\n- Step 1: Start by initializing a variable, \"factor\", to keep track of the potential factors of \"n\".\n- Step 2: Iterate through numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of \"n\".\n- Step 3: Within the loop, check if the current number is a factor of \"n\" using the modulus operator (%).\n- Step 4: If the current number is a factor of \"n\", update the value of \"n\" by dividing it by the factor.\n- Step 5: Continue the loop until the square root of \"n\" is reached and remember to update the value of \"factor\" whenever a factor is found.\n- Step 6: Finally, return the last value of \"n\" as it will be the largest prime factor of the original input number.\n\n4. Test cases:\nIt is the responsibility of the developer to generate test cases to validate the functionality of the \"largest_prime_factor\" function. The developer should create test cases considering various scenarios, including both positive and negative test cases to ensure the function behaves as expected. The provided example test cases can be used as a starting point:\n\n```python\nassert largest_prime_factor(13195) == 29\nassert largest_prime_factor(2048) == 2\n```\n\nThe developer should aim to cover edge cases and potential corner cases to ensure the robustness of the function.\n\nIn addition to the above steps, the developer should also consider the following best practices:\n- Implement error handling for cases where the input number, \"n\", is less than or equal to 1 or is a prime number, as it violates the assumption made in the requirement.\n- Use meaningful variable names, comments, and adhere to PEP 8 coding style guidelines for better code readability and maintainability.\n- Document the function using Python docstrings for clarity and ease of understanding for future maintainers of the code.\n\nOnce the developer has completed the implementation of the \"largest_prime_factor\" function, it should be handed over to the quality assurance testers for thorough testing. The testers should utilize the unit tests provided in the requirements to validate the developed function and ensure that it works correctly as per the given specifications. They should also conduct additional testing to cover various scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure the function's correctness and robustness.\n\nThe high-level plan outlined above provides a roadmap for the developers to implement the \"largest_prime_factor\" function and ensures that the quality assurance testers have clear guidelines to validate the developed function. Through effective project management and collaboration between the project leader, developers, and quality assurance testers, the team can ensure the successful and timely completion of the project."}

{"HumanEval/59Project Leader1": "As the project leader, I will devise a high-level plan to manage the development of the `largest_prime_factor` function.

Function Signature:\nThe function signature for `largest_prime_factor` should be as follows:\n```python\ndef largest_prime_factor(n: int):\n```\nThis signature includes the function name (`largest_prime_factor`) and specifies that it takes one parameter (`n`) of type `int`.\n\n3. NL Description and Plan:\nThe `largest_prime_factor` function should return the largest prime factor of a given number `n`. It is assumed that `n` is greater than 1 and is not a prime number.\n\nTo implement this function, developers should follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Initialize a variable `largest_prime` to 2. This variable will keep track of the largest prime factor found so far.\n\nStep 2: Create a loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). For each number `i` in the loop, do the following:\n\n   - Check if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, update `n` to the result of `n` divided by `i`.\n   - Check if `i` is a prime number. If it is, update `largest_prime` to `i`.\n\nStep 3: After the loop ends, the remaining value of `n` will be the largest prime factor. Update `largest_prime` to `n`.\n\nStep 4: Return `largest_prime` as the result.\n\n4. Test cases:\nThe developers should generate their own test cases for the `largest_prime_factor` function. They should ensure to test different inputs, including both small and large numbers, to verify the correctness of their implementation.\n\nBy following this high-level plan, the developers will be able to implement the `largest_prime_factor` function according to the provided requirement."}

{"HumanEval/104Project Leader1": "Here is a high-level plan outlining the major steps for implementing the `unique_digits` function:\n\n1. Import Statement:\n   - Developers need to include the following import statement at the top of their code:\n     ```python\n     import math\n     ```\n\n2. Function Signature:\n   - The developers need to develop a function called `unique_digits` that takes a list of positive integers `x` as a parameter. The function signature should be as follows:\n     ```python\n     def unique_digits(x):\n     ```\n\n3. NL Description:\n   - The `unique_digits` function should return a sorted list of all elements in `x` that do not contain any even digit. The returned list should be sorted in increasing order.\n   - Developers should ensure that the function follows the requirements and specifications mentioned in the NL description.\n\n4. Test cases:\n   - Developers should generate their own test cases based on the provided NL description. The test cases should cover different scenarios and edge cases to ensure the correctness of the function. \n\n   Example test cases:\n   ```python\n   assert unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1]) == [1, 15, 33]\n   assert unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10]) == []\n   ```\n\nOnce the developers have completed their implementation, they can test their code using the generated test cases to ensure the correctness of their solution."}

Test cases:\nDevelopers should create their own test cases to validate the function's implementation. Test cases should cover various scenarios such as minimum input, maximum input, and other random cases to ensure comprehensive testing.\n\nPlease note that the step-by-step implementation details are intentionally omitted from this plan to allow developers the flexibility to write the code according to their preferred style.

You must instruct the quality assurance testers to perform the necessary tests to validate the developed function.\n\n1. Function Name:\n   - The function should be named `prod_signs`.\n\n2. Parameters:\n   - The function should take a single parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers.\n\n3. Return value:\n   - The function should return a value that matches the expected output as per the requirement.\n\n4. Empty List Handling:\n   - The function should return `None` if the input `arr` is empty.\n\n5. Test Cases:\n   - The quality assurance testers should ensure that the developers have written test cases to validate the implementation of the function.\n   - The testers should use the provided unit tests in the requirement, such as `prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9` and `prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0`, to validate the correctness of the function.\n\n6. Boundary Cases:\n   - The testers should also test the function with boundary cases, such as an empty list, a list with only one element, and a list with multiple elements, including positive, negative, and zero values.\n   - The boundary tests should cover all possible scenarios and edge cases.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - The testers should ensure that the function handles any potential errors or exceptions gracefully, without crashing or causing unexpected behavior.\n\n8. Performance Testing:\n   - The testers should perform performance testing on the function to ensure that it executes within acceptable time limits for large inputs.\n\n9. Test Coverage:\n   - The testers should aim for maximum test coverage to ensure that all code paths and logic branches are tested.\n\n10. Documentation:\n    - The testers should verify that adequate documentation, including function signature, NL descriptions, and any additional comments, is present for the function.\n\nBy following this plan and conducting thorough testing, the quality assurance testers will ensure that the developed function meets the requirements and is ready for deployment."}
