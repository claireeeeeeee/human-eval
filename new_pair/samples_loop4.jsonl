{"task_id": "HumanEval/0", "completion": "```python\ndef has_close_elements(numbers, threshold):\n    result = False\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):\n            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:\n                result = True\n                break\n    return result\n```\n\nThe above Python code implements the `has_close_elements` function based on the provided high-level implementation plan. The function iterates through the list of numbers, comparing each number with subsequent numbers to check if their absolute difference is less than the threshold. If a close pair is found, the function sets the `result` variable to `True` and breaks out of the inner loop. Finally, the function returns the value of `result`."}
