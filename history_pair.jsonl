It takes a list of floats as input and calculates the mean absolute deviation around the mean of the dataset.\n\nI have written the function using a list comprehension to calculate the absolute deviations for each number in the input list. The mean absolute deviation is then calculated by summing all the absolute deviations and dividing by the number of elements in the list.\n\nI have also added a docstring to provide a clear description of the function, its arguments, return type, and some examples.\n\nNow I will hand over the code to the observer for inspection.", "I'm starting to write the code now.
